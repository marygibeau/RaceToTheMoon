# RaceToTheMoon

This is a game made for a Serious Games class at UNC. Our client was Moorehead Planetarium and the game will be used in an exhibit there to celebrate the Apollo 12 moon landing. The core game play was made by a team of collaborators but I was commissioned to continue the project by Moorehead Planetarium over the summer of 2020.
